[-] water
      [X] flat shading with vertex colors
      [X] dynamically generate normal map from moving plane
      [ ] better waves
      [ ] murky depths
      [ ] under water camera
      [ ] splash with collision

[-] movable character
      [X] uses gravity
      [ ] moves around spherical planet

[-] terrain
      [X] flat shading with vertex colors
      [ ] painted vertex colors from Blender

[-] spherical world
      [X] water updated
      [X] gravity updated
      [X] camera updated
      [X] orbiting around sun
      [ ] atmostphere instead of skybox

[ ] time of day
      [ ] rotating directional light
      [ ] different ambient color throughout the day
      [ ] blended transition of skybox
      [ ] color grading for cooler night colors

[ ] color palettes
      [ ] try randomization, based on threshold, first
      [ ] custom editor -- only if randomization doesn't work well
      [ ] imported models map colors to palettes
      [ ] colors are randomized from palette
      [ ] colors change over time, in a coroutine

[X] integrate arcadia configuration
      [X] automagic reloading

polyvore
  low poly
  complex behaviors for simple meshes
    ecosystem affected by the player
  consumption of the world and generation of poop
    used for crafting and progression
    sliding window of past N things eaten
      can be made larger with evolution
  ultimate goal to mate with females to evolve
  multiple planets
    evolving enough will allow flying between them
  final evolution can fly and swim and stuff
  game ends

core game loop
  eat plants, bugs, and animals
    why?
      to poop
  explore the environment in depth
    why?
      to find more to eat
      to fill out the encyclopedia
        details on each ingredient and combination
        history of previous combinations
  poop, based on combinations of food
    why?
      to create fire
        eating the right combination and farting/pooping it out
      to make weapons?
      to make bait for prey
        juicy berries with meat
      to make more stuff to eat
      to spread plants?
      to use special abilities
        they consume food stored in the belly, like fuel
          high jumps and flight
          defensive and offensive attacks
      to build a love den and finally mate
        females want a lot of poop, of specific kinds, in one area
          new areas have females which want new poop
            requires exploration and daring acts in order to get the right food
        use mating call to bring them over
  fight bosses
    why?
      to take their dens and mate
  mate
    why?
      each offspring is mutated in a way which improves capabilities
        stronger teeth (biting rocks and such)
        stomach size
        jumping/flying
        swimming
        to withstand certain elements
        digging?

survival:
  plant growth and resource management
    dynamic biomes and terrain coloring
  winter: eat hot food and stay warm
  keep a fire going at night

action:
  much more involved combat
    varied enemies and more offensive skills
